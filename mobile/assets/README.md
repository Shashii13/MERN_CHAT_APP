# Assets Directory

This directory should contain the following assets for the Expo app:

- `icon.png` - App icon (1024x1024px)
- `splash.png` - Splash screen image
- `adaptive-icon.png` - Android adaptive icon
- `favicon.png` - Web favicon

For development, Expo will use default assets if these files are missing. You can generate them later using tools like:
- Expo's asset generator
- Online icon generators
- Design tools like Figma

The app will work without these assets, but they're required for production builds.
